# Project Overview: Legally - A Legal AI Chatbot

Legally is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help users better understand Indian law by providing clear, accurate, and context-aware legal information. The chatbot's main objective
is to assist individuals in comprehending the legal implications of various actions, offering corresponding punishments or penalties as outlined in Indian law for specific crimes or offenses.

By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot delivers highly accurate, context-specific legal advice, making it 
a valuable tool for legal research, education, and decision-making. The project aims to democratize access to legal knowledge and empower users with the ability to understand the law more easily
